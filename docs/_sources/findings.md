# Summary Findings

Using the full set of over 15k publications from the original database export, DOIs were loaded into Incites (Web of Science).  Raw metadata was also extracted from Crossref for comparison.

Primary findings are presented from Incites data.

There is a tremendous amount of multi-disciplinarity to the XSEDE research areas and many papers overlap in their topics.  Some of the top research areas by publication counts are listed below, which show the number of papers where the research area appeared, but not necessarily exclusive (i.e. there could have been additional cross listed research areas ):
