# Publications

The total publications is a reflection of many years of data collection.  There are two issues that need to be considered:

1. the number of publications reported is a _proxy_ for the total number of publications and is practically _unknowable_
2. the number of publications for which there is data varies from index to index, where indices like Web of Science, may not reflect the total number of journals in the dataset

In the original dataset, there were over 15k publications (including duplicates), recalling that these publications are _self-reported_.  The number of publications found does likely reflect the underlying distribution of all publications, and as such should be considered a _large sample_ of all XSEDE publications.
